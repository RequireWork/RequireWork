Student, Developer, Human, Gamer, I Don't Know What Else

Going through military right now.

[Military Experience]
📑ㅇ Frequently using Hancom Document/Excel/Show in order to gather, compile and spread information sourcing from the main division and brigade.
☎️ㅇ Through constant changes in plans and strategies to tackle overnight duties, battalion was reported as the battalion with the least shortcoming during April.
🥈ㅇ Physical Training everyday and personal maintenance time spent on weak muscle training resulted in Failing Grade→2nd Grade.
⛑️ㅇ Currently the Co-Leader of the Headquarter Squad, focusing on solving small conflicts between squads and encouraging junior soldiers to join in physical training.
⚽ㅇ Favorite personal maintenance time sports are Futsal(Left wing), Badminton(Single), Boxing

[Except for that]
Here are my 5 favourite games I've played until now(This will definitely change but I hope to keep them this way)
🏛️ - Superliminal: A game that taught me something
🌊 - Bioshock: Absolutely inspiring and amazing. Imagine a city under the sea.
🌃- Dishonored: My favourite stealth game I've played until now.
🎭- Persona 5: I don't really play JRPGs but wow, this was amazing
🤖- Nier Replicant: Favourite game to be replayed.

[My 5 hobbies]
- Futsal, Soccer: I'm not a great player but I absolutely enjoy it(Started recently while in Military!)
- Reading any type of interesting book: I will grab a book and set a 3 month finish goal for it.
- Piano, Guitar: I love playing music, listening to music so I got into Piano and Guitar.
- Game Developing: I like to make games part time though they are always stopped at the starting point or crushed by the amount of load. Doesn't mean I give up easily though.
- Video Editing: I got into it during highschol and I don't really want to forget it.

This is it for now,
I will definitely change and rearrange this however.
