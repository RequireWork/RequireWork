🌊 - Bioshock: Absolutely inspiring and amazing. Imagine a city under the sea.
🌃- Dishonored: My favourite stealth game I've played until now.

[My 5 hobbies]
👣 - Futsal, Soccer: I'm not a great player but I absolutely enjoy it(Started recently while in Military!)
📖 - Reading any type of interesting book: I will grab a book and set a 3 month finish goal for it.
     (Current Finished Book list)
     - And Then There Were None [07.06]
🎹 - Piano, Guitar: I love playing music, listening to music so I got into Piano and Guitar.
🎮 - Game Developing: I like to make games part time though they are always stopped at the starting point or crushed by the amount of load. Doesn't mean I give up easily though.
📽️ - Video Editing: I got into it during highschol and I don't really want to forget it.
🥊 - Boxing: I like to do a ton of cardio workout but I didn't know how to do it in a fun way, so I chose boxing! Fun and a ton of Cardio.

This is it for now,
I will definitely change and rearrange this however.
