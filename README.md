     - And Then There Were None [07.06] <br>
🎹 - Piano, Guitar: I love playing music, listening to music so I got into Piano and Guitar. <br>
🎮 - Game Developing: I like to make games part time though they are always stopped at the starting point or crushed by the amount of load. Doesn't mean I give up easily though. <br>
📽️ - Video Editing: I got into it during highschol and I don't really want to forget it. <br>
🥊 - Boxing: I like to do a ton of cardio workout but I didn't know how to do it in a fun way, so I chose boxing! Fun and a ton of Cardio. <br>
