Going through military right now. <br>
<br>
[Military Experience] <br>
📑 ㅇ Frequently using Hancom Document/Excel/Show in order to gather, compile and spread information sourcing from the main division and brigade. <br>
☎️ ㅇ Our Battalion was reported as the battalion with the least shortcomings during April(Won the best battalion for teamwork) and June(Won the best battalion for consistency). <br>
🥈 ㅇ Physical Training everyday and personal maintenance time spent on weak muscle training resulted in a change from Failing Grade to 2nd Grade soldier.(60+ Pushups(2min), 70+ Situps(2min), 13:30> in 3km Sprinting) <br>
⛑️ ㅇ Currently the Co-Leader of the Headquarter Squad, focusing on solving small conflicts between squads and encouraging junior soldiers to join in physical training and social activities(Futsal,badminton). <br>
⚽ ㅇ Favorite personal maintenance time sports are Futsal(Left wing), Badminton(Single), Boxing(Coach), Tabletop Tennis(1v1) <br>
🖥️ ㅇ Coding in military nowadays, taking my time on getting back onto the topics I studied before!(Currently have a LinkedIn page for this!https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwon-yihyun-5389a730b/) <br>

<br>
[Except for that] <br>
Here are my 7 favourite games I've played until now(This will definitely change but I hope to keep them this way) <br>
🏛️ - Superliminal: A game that taught me something <br> 
🌊 - Bioshock: Absolutely inspiring and amazing. Imagine a city under the sea. <br>
🌃 - Dishonored: My favourite stealth game I've played until now. <br>
🎭 - Persona 5: I don't really play JRPGs but wow, this was amazing <br>
🤖 - Nier Replicant: Favourite game to replay! Every experience is a new experience. <br>
🃏 - Balatro: I'm not into gambling. BUT
{More to be added soon!} <br>
<br>
[My hobbies] <br>
👣 - Futsal, Soccer: I'm not a great player but I absolutely enjoy it(Played over 30 games in Military! Our team got 2nd place during the brigade tournaments!) <br>
📖 - Reading any type of interesting book: I will grab a book and set a 3 month finish goal for it. <br>
     (Current Finished Book list) <br>
     - And Then There Were None [07.06] <br>
     - Farenheit 451 [09.13] <br>
🎹 - Piano, Guitar: I love playing music, listening to music so I got into Piano and Guitar.(I can play 3 songs at most through!) <br>
🎮 - Game Developing: I like to make games part time though they are always stopped at the starting point or crushed by the amount of load. Doesn't mean I give up easily though. <br>
     - In Military, I cannot develop games as the tools necessary cannot be provided due to security reasons. Because of this, I take my time coding to do better later on when I get back
       to my laptop! <br>
📽️ - Video Editing: I got into it during highschol and I don't really want to forget it. I also did this in order to see how the Youtube algorithm works! <br>
🥊 - Boxing: I like to do a ton of cardio workout but I didn't know how to do it in a fun way, so I chose boxing! Fun and a ton of Cardio. <br>
‎‍🎓 - Studying: Military encourages every soldier to study during free time since a smart soldier is a ton better than one that moves on instinct! So we have study groups here that normally are given 7 hours a week to study!
<br>
<br>
This is it for now, <br>
I will definitely change and rearrange this however.  <br>
