Student, Developer, Human, Gamer, I Don't Know What Else
I love using caps on a ton of sentences.
I've been through military 
I've been through highschools and unis

Here are my 5 favourite games I've played until now(This will definitely change but I hope to keep them this way)
- Superliminal: A game that taught me something
- Bioshock: Absolutely inspiring and amazing. Imagine a city under the sea.
- Dishonored: My favourite stealth game I've played until now.
- Persona 5: I don't really play JRPGs but wow, this was amazing
- Nier Replicant: Favourite game to be replayed.

My 5 hobbies are
- Futsal, Soccer: I'm not a great player but I absolutely enjoy it
- Reading any type of interesting book: I will grab a book and set a 3 month finish goal for it.
- Piano, Guitar: I love playing music, listening to music so I got into Piano and Guitar.
- Game Developing: I like to make games part time though they are always stopped at the starting point or crushed by the amount of load. Doesn't mean I give up easily though.
- Video Editing: I got into it during highschol and I don't really want to forget it.

This is it for now,
I will definitely change and rearrange this however.
